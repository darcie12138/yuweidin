After running and warming up with them, the children eagerly requested to start playing games. Eason and Ty led the boys in playing \u0026lsquo;Monkey Tricks\u0026rsquo; on the basketball court, while Xiao Liang and C Zhang guided the girls in a game of \u0026lsquo;Sticking Plasters\u0026rsquo; on the track. The boys quickly grew tired of these games and divided into two teams, asking us to play basketball with them. They were rowdy but also innocent and sincere. That day, after the classes and returning to our homestay, we all reflected on the experience, feeling a return to a sense of pure joy, inspired by these tireless children running back and forth on the sports field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\r\n  \u003ca class=\"paragraph-image\"\u003e\r\n    \u003cimg data-src=\"/img/jinxi-11.png\" data-action=\"zoom\" alt=\"\"  class=\"lazyload\"\u003e\r\n  \u003c/a\u003e\r\n  \r\n\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\r\n  \u003ca class=\"paragraph-image\"\u003e\r\n    \u003cimg data-src=\"/img/jinxi-12.png\" data-action=\"zoom\" alt=\"Physical Exercise\"  class=\"lazyload\"\u003e\r\n  \u003c/a\u003e\r\n  \r\n\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore leaving, we prepared postcards from Zhejiang University and notebooks for every child we had taught, inscribing them with heartfelt wishes and blessings from us. What we didn\u0026rsquo;t expect was the children, during the break, carefully opening the door of the rest room and presenting us with Teacher\u0026rsquo;s Day greeting cards and flowers they had folded themselves. The cards were simple, just a piece of cardboard with crooked writing like \u0026lsquo;Happy Teacher\u0026rsquo;s Day, Little Fish\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Wishing the teacher academic success,\u0026rsquo; revealing the purest feelings and insights of these young, inexperienced children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\r\n  \u003ca class=\"paragraph-image\"\u003e\r\n    \u003cimg data-src=\"/img/jinxi-13.png\" data-action=\"zoom\" alt=\"Post Cards from Melton Fellows\"  class=\"lazyload\"\u003e\r\n  \u003c/a\u003e\r\n  \r\n\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\r\n  \u003ca class=\"paragraph-image\"\u003e\r\n    \u003cimg data-src=\"/img/jinxi-14.png\" data-action=\"zoom\" alt=\"\"  class=\"lazyload\"\u003e\r\n  \u003c/a\u003e\r\n  \r\n\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\r\n  \u003ca class=\"paragraph-image\"\u003e\r\n    \u003cimg data-src=\"/img/jinxi-15.png\" data-action=\"zoom\" alt=\"Smile\"  class=\"lazyload\"\u003e\r\n  \u003c/a\u003e\r\n  \r\n\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hadn\u0026rsquo;t anticipated that just a week\u0026rsquo;s interaction would make the children cry and not want us to leave. Perhaps they were simply afraid of parting, because to them, we were the big brothers and sisters who would run around the playground with them and reward them with candy. A third grader asked me, \u0026lsquo;Teacher, will you forget about us after you leave?\u0026rsquo; That moment touched me deeply. He might not yet understand what this journey meant for them and for us, but to me, the children\u0026rsquo;s clear sense of right and wrong, their innocence and authenticity, gave me a wonderful sense of security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch5 id=\"wechat-post-link\"\u003eWechat post link:\u003ca class=\"anchorjs-link\" href=\"#wechat-post-link\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ddhBP-hCHSrLnF8AIdHJTg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ddhBP-hCHSrLnF8AIdHJTg\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","tags":"MF Project","title":"Jinxi Support Education","url":"/posts/jinxi-support-education/"}]
